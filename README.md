# Samuel Kuczynski Stock Analysis

### Overview of Project

#### The purpose of this analysis was to help recent graduate Steve provide Stock Analysis for his parents. We were wanting to create a VBA script so that we could automate tracking different tickers (stocks), throughout the years. We would then use this analysis to determine if each stock was worth investing in so that we can study as many stocks as possible efficiently. 

#### We had initially created this program using nested for loops however we were concerned with how long it was taking to manuever  through just one year of data. So Steve and I decided to see if we can make things more efficient by refactoring our code. Specificaly we wanted to go through and remove the nested loops that were going between two worksheets and instead try and write code that was able to stay in one loop and gather the data to store it in arrays. 

### Results

#### We were able to cut down the time drastically. The 2017 code went from 0.53 seconds to run: down to 0.11 seconds. The 2018 code went from 0.54 seconds to run: down to 0.11 seconds. As we look to add further code down the line this will go a long way in making sure that our entire file doesnâ€™t crash or take too long to execute. This cut down in time was the biggest advantage to come from this exercise. The only downside in this practice did take quite a while to execute. With more complex code I could see this taking a lot of time to master, but I believe I did learn much more about this code while working through it.
