# Samuel Kuczynski Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this analysis was to help recent graduate Steve provide Stock Analysis for his parents. We were wanting to create a VBA script so that we could automate tracking different tickers (stocks), throughout the years. We would then use this analysis to determine if each stock was worth investing in so that we can study as many stocks as possible efficiently. 

### We had initially created this program using nested for loops however we were concerned with how long it was taking to manuever  through just one year of data. So Steve and I decided to see if we can make things more efficient by refactoring our code. Specificaly we wanted to go through and remove the nested loops that were going between two worksheets and instead try and write code that was able to stay in one loop and gather the data to store it in arrays.

### [VBA Challenge 2018] (https://github.com/SKuczynski17/Stock_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png)

### We were able to cut down the time drastically. The 2017 code went from 0.53 seconds to run; down to 0.11 seconds. The 2018 code went from 0.54 seconds to run; down to 0.11 seconds.
